# My portfolio

## Description

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, ThreeJS for 3D rendering, and PHP to handle the contact form.

I built JSON dictionaries to make the site dynamically trilingual. 

This is my very first website using ThreeJS. I really had fun with this library and I am planning to explore it further. 

The concept was to create an immersive experience, similar to the aesthetics of video games. It's designed to showcase how modern JavaScript frameworks can be integrated with traditional server-side languages to create dynamic and visually engaging web applications. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: Necessary to run the development environment and manage packages.
- Three.js: A JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics on the web.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A JavaScript tool for creating animations.
- Vite: A modern build tool that significantly improves the development experience.

Install the necessary Node.js packages:
`npm install --save three`
`npm install --save-dev vite`
`npm install gsap`

## Running the application locally

To run the application locally, use the following command: `npx vite`.

## Building for Production

Run `npx vite build` to build the folder that is used in production.

This command compiles your application into static files optimized for production deployment.

## Test the final built version

Run `npx serve dist` to test the built version that will be used in production.
